inventory.json is the file the api edits to keep track of the inventory.
When the API edits it, is write it all in a single line, so it is hard to read.

test-inventory-template.json acts as an easy to read template for the test values
which we can pop into inventory.json file. Just copy and paste the contents of 
test-inventory-template.json into inventory.json it's good to go.
