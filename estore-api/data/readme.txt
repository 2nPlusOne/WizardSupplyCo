inventory.json is the file the api edits to keep track of the inventory.
When the API edits it, is write it all in a single line, so it is hard to read.

inventory-pretty.json is the same file, but with new lines and indentation.
It acts as an easy to read template for the inventory.json file. Just copy and 
paste the contents of inventory-pretty.json into inventory.json it's good to go.
